  					<p class="lead">In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</p>
  					<p>Hi, I am Boris! I am 29 and I come from Ljubljana, Slovenia. I like martial arts, all kinds of sports that involve some kind of board, keeping a healthy lifestyle, and nurturing my foodie habits on regular basis. I'm a biochemist by training but never followed the scientific career path getting into entrepreneurship during the last year of my MSc studies and taking over a large chunk of our family run business in field of scientific equipment. Currently, I oversee all of our purchasing and logistical activities while helping others with anything else that for some reason lacks attention in our company.</p>

  					<p class="lead">Why are you taking this course?</p>
  					<p>Being self-employed and wearing many hats in our family business, I have realized that I kept stumbling on things that seemed so easy for other people. Managing a website, an online shop, creating landing pages to test ideas, and similar tasks had to be outsourced and had a »Great Unknown« feeling to them. Coming from scientific background, I have always had an itch for finding out how things work. So many times have I watched with some sort of jealousy all my coding-savvy friends creating something seemingly out of nothing just by what seemed to be proficiency in another language. Every time this fueled my curiosity. Last year I have at last decided to scratch this itch of mine and finally acquire this toolbox that will allow me to explore and build my ideas.</p>

  					<p>I do not have much previous experience with programming. I have successfully completed the Fundamentals of Website Development course in spring 2014 semester at HES and I am half way through the JavaScript course on CodeCademy.</p>
